# PDF Documents

This directory contains PDF documents for download from the TechSoft Systems website.

## Current PDF Files

- `johnathan-carroll-resume.pdf` - Resume PDF for download from the resume page
- `johnathan-carroll-cover-letter.pdf` - Cover Letter PDF for download from the cover letter page

## PDF Generation

These are placeholder PDF files. To replace them with actual content:

1. Generate proper PDF versions of the resume and cover letter
2. Replace the placeholder files with the generated PDFs
3. Keep the same filenames to maintain the existing links

## Usage

These PDFs are linked from:

- `resume.html` - Links to `johnathan-carroll-resume.pdf`
- `cover-letter.html` - Links to `johnathan-carroll-cover-letter.pdf`

The download links include the `download` attribute to prompt the browser to download the file rather than opening it in a new tab.

## Updating PDFs

When updating the content of these PDFs:

1. Maintain the same filenames to avoid having to update the HTML links
2. Ensure the PDFs are properly formatted and professional in appearance
3. Keep file sizes reasonable (ideally under 1MB) for fast downloads

## Future Improvements

Consider adding:

- Version tracking for PDF documents
- Additional formats (DOCX, etc.) if needed
- Print-optimized versions
