## Context
An enterprise team needed internal AI capabilities without sending confidential data to external SaaS platforms.

## Problem
The organization lacked a controlled model-serving platform with predictable latency, governance controls, and operational visibility.

## Approach
We designed a private AI stack with containerized inference services, access policies, observability, and workload tuning for sustained demand.

## Architecture
- GPU inference tier with queue-based request handling
- API and UI services isolated by role-aware access controls
- Retrieval and caching layers for repeat query acceleration
- Unified telemetry for latency, GPU utilization, and policy events

## Results and Metrics
- 30,000 secure on-prem queries per day at steady state
- P95 latency reduced by 38% after inference tuning
- 100% authenticated access with auditable request logs

## Tools and Stack
NVIDIA GPU nodes, Docker service composition, vLLM inference, Open-WebUI interface, and Loki-based log pipelines.

## Lessons Learned
Private AI programs succeed when platform reliability and governance are treated as first-class requirements alongside model quality.
