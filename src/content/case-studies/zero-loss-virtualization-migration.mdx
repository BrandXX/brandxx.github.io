## Context
A multi-site organization needed to modernize its virtualization platform without disrupting business-critical systems.

## Problem
Legacy clusters were capacity-constrained, backup posture was inconsistent, and there was no reliable rollback model for large migration waves.

## Approach
We built a migration-factory model with discovery baselines, dependency mapping, pilot waves, validation gates, and automated post-cutover checks.

## Architecture
- Dual-track source and target environments during migration windows
- Snapshot plus backup verification before each cutover wave
- Automated inventory and topology mapping for dependency-aware sequencing
- Defined rollback checkpoints for every migration batch

## Reference Architecture
<ArchitecturePlaceholder title="Zero-loss migration architecture" />

## Results and Metrics
- 100+ servers migrated with zero data loss
- 97% first-pass cutover success rate
- 41% reduction in backup job failures after standardization

## Tools and Stack
VMware, Proxmox, Veeam, Terraform automation, and NetBox-backed inventory controls.

## Lessons Learned
Migration speed and safety both improve when validation checkpoints are automated and rollback criteria are explicit before each wave begins.
