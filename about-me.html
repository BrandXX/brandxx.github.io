      <p>
        For more than two decades, Jonathan has been the "quiet hero in the server room,"
        architecting and rescuing IT infrastructures across Tucson and the Southwest. From taming
        sprawling Cisco UCS blade clusters and Nutanix hyperconverged infrastructure to virtualizing mission-critical workloads on Hyper-V,
        VMware, and AHV Acropolis, he's spent his career turning chaotic networks into bullet-proof, high-performance ecosystems.
      </p>

      <h2 class="first-heading">Why Clients Call Us</h2>

      <h3>Enterprise-grade know-how, SMB approachability</h3>
      <p>
        Jonathan has managed everything from government datacenters to hospitality MSP networks—yet
        he still answers his own phone.
      </p>

      <h3>Full-stack infrastructure expertise</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Virtualization (VMware, Hyper-V, AHV Acropolis)</li>
        <li>Containerization (Docker, Docker Swarm, Docker Compose)</li>
        <li>Storage (Pure, NetApp, Dell EMC)</li>
        <li>Networking (Cisco, HP/Aruba)</li>
        <li>Windows & Azure Active Directory</li>
        <li>Cyber-security platforms like Darktrace and Carbon Black</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>AI & LLM innovation</h3>
      <p>
        When he's not tightening rack screws, Jonathan contributes to the Open-WebUI project
        and designs on-prem AI stacks powered by NVIDIA GPUs (Consumer, PRO, and Enterprise)—so your data stays inside
        your walls, not in someone else's cloud. His containerized deployments using Docker, Docker Swarm, and Docker Compose
        ensure scalable, portable, and resilient infrastructure.

      <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Security first, always.</strong> If it isn't hardened, monitored, and auditable, it's not shipping.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Plain-English transparency.</strong> We translate tech jargon into actionable insights
        (and yes, occasional geeky sarcasm).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Future-proof solutions.</strong> We build with next-gen scalability in mind, so you're ready
        for tomorrow's workloads without ripping out today's investments.
      </p>

      <h2>Track Record of Results</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Pascua Yaqui Tribe Government</strong> – Led the modernization of a multi-site infrastructure,
        slashing downtime and rolling out cutting-edge endpoint security.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>TBM Equities / Sahara Apartments</strong> – Migrated legacy servers to a fully virtualized
        Hyper-V environment and deployed an enterprise backup strategy, boosting resilience while trimming OPEX.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>BestComm Networks</strong> – Engineered MSP toolsets that supported hundreds of Best Western
        hotel branches—because sleep is overrated when packets are dropping.
      </p>

      <h2>Community & Continuous Learning</h2>
      <p>
        Jonathan earned his first programming certificate writing COBOL (yes, really) and never stopped
        leveling up—from early certificates in digital electronics to hands-on experimentation with
        FP16 AI model fine-tuning. When Tucson's tech community needs a guest speaker on LLM infrastructure
        or a last-minute mentor for STEM students, he's there.
      </p>
